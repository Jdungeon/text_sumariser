            "          Marketing is according to Dr. Philip Kotler, the science and art of discovering, developing, and providing value to meet the demands of a target market while making a profit (Woolley 2016). One of the principal components of strategic marketing is market segmentation. Market segmentation is the division of the market into various submarkets that are identical within but differ from each other (Usman, Lizam, and Adekunle 2020). It is a decision-making tool that will help the marketing manager in matching a given product with its optimal target market and therefore help in making the perfect marketing collateral. In the most ideal conditions, when market segmentation is done right, consumers will be placed into a submarket with other consumers sharing very similar characteristics. At the same time, consumers in other submarkets will be different from one another with respect to those consumer characteristics. Market segmentation is very beneficial as a whole. The most common benefit of segmentation is that it aids organisations to consider their actual position and plan out their future moves. In other words, segmentation helps congeries in identifying what they are particularly good at compared to their competitors while also discover the real desires of consumers (Dolnicar, Grün, and Leisch 2018). Furthermore, Market segmentation helps improve the performance of marketing campaigns by enabling marketers to target the right messages to the right people at the right time. Segmentation gives the marketing agent more information about their audience so that they can tailor the message according to the consumers’ tastes and needs. This will enable businesses to create products that better match their audiences’ needs (Lotame Solutions, Inc. 2019). Before segments are divided in a market, the marketing agent needs to evaluate which segmentation criterion to use. Segmentation criterion refers to the source of information used in market segmentation. The segmentation criterion is usually divided into bases.\n"
